= Axiom.jl Roadmap

== Current Baseline (v1.0.0)

Axiom.jl currently ships:

* Core tensor/layer pipeline in Julia
* Verification checks (`@ensure`, property checks, certificates)
* Optional Rust backend integration hooks
* GPU extension hooks for CUDA/ROCm/Metal

Current priority is stabilization: build/test/runtime reliability, accurate docs, and explicit feature status.

== Near-Term Plan

=== Must

* [ ] Complete backend parity and reliability for CPU + Rust + GPU extension paths.
* [ ] Harden verification/certificate workflows for repeatable CI and artifact integrity.
* [ ] Keep README/wiki claims aligned with tested behavior.

Must completion gates:

* [ ] Core-op parity tests pass on CPU Julia and Rust backend (matmul, dense, conv, normalization, activations) with documented tolerance budgets.
* [ ] GPU extension paths (CUDA/ROCm/Metal) have deterministic CI jobs where hardware is available, and explicit fallback-behavior tests where it is not.
* [ ] `instantiate/build/precompile/test` succeeds in CI on supported Julia versions without manual steps.
* [ ] Runtime smoke tests for documented examples pass on CPU and at least one accelerated backend.
* [ ] No unresolved `TODO`/`FIXME`/`TBD` markers in `src`, `ext`, and `test` for release-scoped areas.

=== Should

* [ ] Improve performance benchmarking and regression tracking across backends.
* [ ] Expand verification property coverage and diagnostics.
* [ ] Strengthen release automation and compatibility testing.

Should completion gates:

* [ ] Baseline benchmark suite published for CPU Julia, Rust, and GPU extension paths with trend tracking.
* [ ] Verification diagnostics include actionable counterexample metadata and failure categorization.
* [ ] Compatibility matrix is validated across OS/Julia combinations used by supported deployments.
* [ ] Release process produces versioned artifacts and changelog validation automatically.

=== Could

* [ ] Add richer model packaging and registry workflows.
* [ ] Expand advanced optimization passes (fusion, mixed precision).
* [ ] Add deeper runtime observability for verification paths.

Could completion gates:

* [ ] Packaging format includes model metadata, verification claims, and reproducible hashes.
* [ ] Optional optimization passes are benchmarked and guarded behind explicit flags.
* [ ] Verification runtime emits structured telemetry suitable for dashboards/incident analysis.

== Deferred Commitments (Tracked)

The following promises remain on the roadmap and are not removed:

. `from_pytorch(...)` import API
. `to_onnx(...)` export API
. Production-hardened GPU paths across CUDA/ROCm/Metal
. Non-GPU accelerators (TPU/NPU/DSP/FPGA) backend strategy
. Proof-assistant export beyond skeleton artifacts

See link:docs/wiki/Roadmap-Commitments.md[docs/wiki/Roadmap-Commitments.md] for staged targets and acceptance criteria.

== Definition of Done for "Production Ready"

. Clean `instantiate/build/precompile/test` on supported Julia versions
. Runtime smoke tests for documented examples pass
. No unresolved work-marker markers in `src`, `ext`, and `test`
. Public docs match implemented APIs and backend support status
