== [Unreleased]

=== Release Notes (2026-02-17)

==== Added APIs
- `proof_assistant_obligation_report(path, assistant; expected_certificate_hash, expected_obligation_id)` for machine-readable Lean/Coq/Isabelle obligation status.
- `reconcile_proof_bundle(manifest_path; assistant_paths, persist=true)` to reconcile assistant artifacts into bundle manifests.
- `coprocessor_capability_report()` for strategy/capability snapshots across `TPUBackend`, `NPUBackend`, `DSPBackend`, and `FPGABackend`.
- `gpu_capability_report()` for CUDA/ROCm/Metal capability + hook coverage snapshots.
- `gpu_runtime_diagnostics()` and `reset_gpu_runtime_diagnostics!()` for machine-readable GPU self-healing/fallback counters.
- `metal_device_count()` exported alongside `cuda_device_count()` / `rocm_device_count()` for explicit GPU device-count introspection.

==== CI
- Coprocessor strategy workflow now generates and uploads `build/coprocessor_evidence.json` as a CI artifact (`coprocessor-evidence`).
- GPU fallback/hardware workflows now generate and upload backend-specific performance evidence artifacts via `scripts/gpu-performance-evidence.jl`.
- Proof assistant bundle workflow now runs `test/ci/proof_bundle_reconciliation.jl` and uploads `build/proof_bundle_evidence.json` generated by `scripts/proof-bundle-evidence.jl`.

==== Fixed
- Isabelle proof skeleton exports now emit explicit unresolved placeholders (`oops`) so reconciliation/import status cannot report incomplete artifacts as complete.

=== Added
- Zig backend with SIMD-optimized operations
- Comprehensive documentation (Architecture, Performance, Safety-Critical, etc.)
- RSR compliance infrastructure (flake.nix, Justfile, security policies)
- Attention mechanisms for transformer models

=== Changed
- Updated Home.md with complete documentation map
- Enhanced verification system documentation

=== Security
- Added SECURITY.md with vulnerability disclosure process
- Added .well-known/security.txt (RFC 9116 compliant)
